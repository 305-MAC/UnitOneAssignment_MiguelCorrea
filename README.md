## Overview and Origin
---
* Propy

* Propy is incorporated as "Propy Inc."
* CEO and Founder, Natalia Karayaneva; Co-founder & VP of Business Development Denitza Tyufekchieva; CFO Maria Angelova. 
* Propy is an end-to-end real estate transaction management platform that facilitates real estate transactions online. The the idea for the company (or project) come about when Founder Natalia Karayaneva, after 15 years experience as a real estate professional, grew frustrated with tedious tasks that could be streamlined and with the amount of fraud in real estate transactions.
* Company had an Initial Coin Offer (ICO) in Aug. 2017. Venture capitalist investor Tim Draper has also provided funding in the most recent round of fundraising for the organization.
* Propy did raise $15, 077, 000 USD with their ICO. The exact amount raised from Tim Draper and the total amount of funding has not been made available by Propy.

## Business Activities

* The companies mission is to make real estate transactions faster, simpler and more secure by using FinTech innovations such as blockchain technology, smart contracts, and NFT's. Their ultimate goal is to automate the real estate sales process.

* The company's intended customers include home buyers, home sellers, transaction coordinators, individual real estate agents, real estate brokerages, and title / escrow companies.
* The market size of the U.S. real estate market in 2020 was $36.2 trillion.
* The solution  this company offers that their competitors do not include eliminating the need for multiple systems for agents to manage their transactions, saving time with the ability to easily track all documents associated with a transaction, and security for document storage. 
* Smart contracts allow completely online and self-driving real estate transactions. Non-Fungible Tokens are used to digitally certify ownership and secure trading of a physical property. Blockchain creates a smooth, transparent transaction with the ability to transfer real-world property ownership rights within minutes while offering higher secuirty and lower fraud risk than a traditional real estate transaction. Propy Utility Tokens (PRO) are used as an investment vehicle for users and partners in the Propy community. DocuSign is used to sign the purchase agreements.

## Landscape

* Propy is in the real estate domain of the financial industry.

* Real estate has been slow with technological advancements. Online real estate companies, online home tours, and online home searches have been some of the major trends and innovations in the real estate domain over the last 5-10 years.
* Keller Williams, RE/Max, Coldwell Banker, Century 21, and Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices are a few of the major companies in the real estate domain.

## Results

* Propy is a blockchain technology startup that has stood out since its inception in 2016. According to Propy, over 10 hours of paperwork per transaction is saved when using their platform.

* Other than profits and sales, which are critical to every industry, some of the core metrics that companies in real estate use to measure success include average commission per sale, average commission per agent, number of properties advertised per agent, sold homes compared to total number of listings in that market, and number of days a property remains on the market from listing to closing. Propy's measurements in these metrics are not available as these numbers will pertain to the real estate agents and brokers that use Propy to increase performance in these areas.
* Propy has processessed $1 billion in transactions using its platform. The number and volume of transactions continue to increase with the adoption of these type of transactions using Blockchain technology. 

## Recommendations

* I would advise Propy to also offer financing options for homebuyers. A peer-to-peer funding format can be used to connect buyers and investors.

* I believe offering this product or service would benefit the company because they will be able to assist buyers looking to purchase but do not want to go through the grueling process of traditional mortgage financing. It would also increase profit margins for funding investors as they are able to transact directly with the end-user.
* Technologies that would be utilized include blockchain, smart contracts, and cryptocurrency.
* Blockchain is appropriate for my solution because it will be used to facilitate a quick, transparent, and safe transaction. Smart contracts can be used to easily track and confirm the agreed upon terms of the peer-to-peer funding. Cryptocurrency can be used to fund the transaction.
